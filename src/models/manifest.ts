 * Model + corpus catalog. Every asset the app can use is declared here with
 * an expected sha256 so ModelManager can verify integrity and the total
 * footprint can be audited against the 50GB storage cap.
 *
 * `required: true` entries are the default LLM + embedding model. They are
 * NOT bundled inside the app build (that keeps the installable app small
 * and fast to build/ship — see modules/bundled-assets + plugins/withBundledModels.js
 * for an alternate fully-bundled build path, still available but not used
 * by default). Instead, on first launch the app shows a mandatory setup
 * screen (src/ui/ModelSetupScreen.tsx in "required" mode) that downloads
 * them — the ONLY time the app needs network access. Once downloaded, the
 * app works fully offline from then on, matching the bounty's "work
 * completely offline once installed" requirement (installed = app +
 * one-time model setup complete).
 *
 * `required: false` entries are optional extras a user can fetch later from
 * the same Models/Settings screen in its normal (non-blocking) mode — either
 * an alternate LLM, or a corpus pack (see TIERS below).
