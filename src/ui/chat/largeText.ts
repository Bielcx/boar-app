 * Chat layout at large text (fontScale >= LARGE_TEXT_SCALE):

 *   tapping sent a question nobody could read in full); 2 lines at normal sizes keep the cards even;
 * - the model error's two buttons stack (Prism CH-12: side by side, "Configurar"/"Recarregar" broke mid-word);
 * - the snippet's overline takes 2 lines (Prism AN-1: at 200% "Da fonte (em inglês) · Monso…" lost the source's name).
